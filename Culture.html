                Pakistani cultural dress is a vibrant reflection of the country's diverse heritage, blending traditional elements with regional variations.
	 	 The most iconic garment is the shalwar kameez, a versatile ensemble worn by both men and women, consisting of a long tunic (kameez) paired with loose-fitting
	 	 trousers (shalwar). Women's versions often feature intricate embroidery, vibrant colors, and are paired with a dupatta, a long scarf that adds a touch of
	 	 elegance and modesty. Men's shalwar kameez tends to be simpler but equally dignified, sometimes accompanied by a waistcoat for formal occasions. In addition
	 	 to the shalwar kameez, each region boasts unique attire: Sindhi ajrak and Sindhi topi, Punjabi phulkari, Balochi turban and dress, and Pashtun peshawari chappal.
 	 	These garments are more than mere clothing; they are a celebration of the rich cultural mosaic that defines Pakistan, encapsulating centuries-old traditions,
	 	artisanal craftsmanship, and the vibrant spirit of its people.

            <p id="paragraph-4">
           Pakistani festivals are a vivid tapestry of cultural heritage, religious observance, and seasonal celebrations, each adding a unique color to the nation's
	   social fabric. Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha are among the most significant Islamic festivals, marked by prayers, feasts, and acts of charity. Eid-ul-Fitr,
	    which follows Ramadan, is characterized by joyous gatherings, new clothes, and a variety of traditional sweets, while Eid-ul-Adha commemorates the willingness
	    of Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son and involves the sacrifice of animals, with the meat distributed among family, friends, and the needy. Independence Day,
	    celebrated on August 14, is a national event full of patriotic fervor, with flag hoisting ceremonies, fireworks, and cultural performances that reflect the spirit 
	   of freedom and unity. Another vibrant festival is Basant, celebrated in Lahore and other parts of Punjab, marking the arrival of spring with kite flying
	    competitions, music, and traditional foods. This festival, though historically rooted in the harvest season, has become a symbol of joy and renewal.
	    Each festival in Pakistan, with its distinct customs, colors, and rhythms, underscores the country’s rich mosaic of traditions and the enduring spirit
	    of its people.

Pakistani cultural music is a rich and diverse expression of the nation's multifaceted heritage, encompassing a wide range of genres and styles that reflect
 the country's various regional, ethnic, and linguistic identities. Traditional forms like Qawwali and Ghazal hold a special place in the musical landscape,
 with Qawwali being a form of devotional music performed at Sufi shrines, known for its powerful vocals and spiritual intensity, popularized by legendary
 artists like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Ghazal, on the other hand, is a poetic form that has been beautifully adapted into music, emphasizing intricate lyrics 
and emotive expression, with maestros such as Mehdi Hassan and Ghulam Ali contributing to its timeless appeal.

Folk music varies significantly across regions,
 with Punjabi Bhangra, Sindhi Sufi music, Pashto Tappa, and Balochi Lewa each bringing distinctive instruments and rhythms to the fore. Instruments like the
 dhol, tabla, sitar, and rubab are central to these traditions, providing the characteristic sounds that define Pakistani folk music. In addition to these
 traditional forms, Pakistan's music scene has evolved to include contemporary genres such as pop, rock, and hip-hop, with artists like Vital Signs, Junoon,
 and Atif Aslam gaining international acclaim. Music festivals and platforms like Coke Studio have played a pivotal role in bridging the gap between the
 traditional and the modern, showcasing the versatility and dynamism of Pakistani music to a global audience. Through its diverse musical expressions, Pakistan
 continues to celebrate its rich cultural legacy while embracing modernity and innovation.

			<p id="heading-6"> Tomb of Jahangir </p>
			<p id="paragraph-6">
			The Tomb of Jahangir, located in Lahore, Pakistan, is a poignant testament to the Mughal era's architectural splendor and historical significance. Constructed between 1627 and 1637, this mausoleum is dedicated to Emperor Jahangir, the fourth ruler of the Mughal Empire, known for his patronage of art, culture, and poetry. Nestled amidst serene surroundings in Shahdara, overlooking the Ravi River, the tomb's design blends Persian and Mughal architectural styles seamlessly. Its iconic four minarets stand tall, symbolizing the four cardinal directions, while the central dome dominates the structure with its majestic presence.

The exterior is adorned with intricate marble inlay work, featuring floral motifs and Quranic inscriptions, showcasing the artisans' skill during the Mughal period. Inside, the tomb chamber is a masterpiece of craftsmanship, with Jahangir's cenotaph adorned with Pietra Dura, a technique where semi-precious stones are inlaid into marble, depicting intricate floral patterns and calligraphy			.

Surrounded by lush gardens, the Tomb of Jahangir offers a tranquil retreat for visitors, reflecting the Mughal fascination with symmetry and gardens as paradisiacal spaces. Over the centuries, the tomb has been lovingly maintained and restored, ensuring that its architectural grandeur and historical significance continue to inspire awe and admiration.
